The main differences between PATCH and PUT methods in HTTP are:

Purpose:

PATCH: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
 It is typically used when you want to update only specific fields of a resource,
  rather than replacing the entire resource.
PUT: The PUT method is used to replace the entire resource at the specified URL with the new 
representation provided in the request.

Idempotency:

PATCH: PATCH requests are not necessarily idempotent, 
meaning that multiple identical PATCH requests might have different effects.

PUT: PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that multiple identical PUT requests will have 
the same effect as a single request.
  This is because the entire resource is replaced with the new representation,
   so subsequent requests will not change the result.

Usage:

PATCH: PATCH is commonly used when you want to make partial updates to a resource,
 such as updating specific fields of an object or document.

PUT: PUT is used when you want to completely replace an existing resource with a new 
representation, typically used for updating or creating resources.

Safety:

PATCH: PATCH requests are considered safe, 
meaning they should not have side effects on the resource.

PUT: PUT requests are not necessarily safe, as they can result in the complete replacement
 of the resource.



In summary, PATCH is used for partial updates, 
while PUT is used for complete replacements of resources.
PATCH is preferred when you want to update specific fields of a resource, 
while PUT is used when you want to replace the entire resource.
